            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Adventurers of the additionall Forces by Sea.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter a long pa≈ø≈øage from London we arrived the 10 of july la≈øt at Kin≈øale
with 10 ≈øaile of our fleet, where the Right Honorable Alexander, Lord
Forbes our Commander, next unto the Right Honorable Lord Brooke,
received intelligence that the Town of Bandonbridge wherein were
7000 Engli≈øh Prote≈øtants was in great want of Amunition, and that the Lord Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery
(the chiefe Rebell) withall his Forces, intended within 5 or 6 dayes to ≈øet upon
the ≈øaid Town, to take it and to put all the Engli≈øh to the Sword, ≈øuch is the rage
malice and hatred of tho≈øe Rebells again≈øt them that they would not ≈øpare man wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nor hild. But by the good providence of Almighty God, we arived in the very
rick of time to the great joy and comfort of the Engli≈øh, and to the terror of the
Rebells, preventing them from their intended de≈øigne.</p>
            <p>The Lord Forbes lo≈øt no time in the exerci≈øing of his men, and the 15 of Iuly with
800 Land and Seamen corragiou≈øly marched towards Bandon for the reliefe of it,
and other Ca≈øtles thereabouts who were blockt up by the Rebells.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Bandon upon ≈øight of the reliefe came unto them from the
Parliament, and the Adventurers in the additional Forces by Sea for Ireland, with
good ≈øtore of Amunition, as Muskets, Powder, Shot and other nece≈ø≈øaries were
much revived, leaping for joy, and returned publick thanks to Almighty God
for his great mercy and goodne≈ø≈øe to them, in ≈øending this ≈øupply in ≈øuch their great
≈øtraight and mi≈øery. Ma≈øter Peters our Mini≈øter preached at Bandon, much incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The 16 of July the Lord Forbes with his 800 men, and 200 Foote and 70 Hor≈øe of
Ban<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>on, marched from thence to cleere the Country of Rebells, that the Engli≈øh
might reap and gather in their harve≈øt; As al≈øo for the reliefe of Raph Barry Ca≈øtle
being from King fale as we marched about 25 Engli≈øh miles; and in our march we
≈øet upon an Engli≈øh Towne called Cloughnieilty, which the Rebels formerly took
and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, which Town we took, and killed of the Rebels about 200, and had
much pillage in it of Corne and Cattell, and there the Lord Forbes left 3. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his men to guard the Towne and village.</p>
            <p>From thence we marched with 700 men, and the troope of Hor≈øe for Raph Barry
Ca≈øtle to relieve Ma≈øter Feak, and about 100 Engli≈øh that were blockt up. We
furni≈øhed them with Men, Cowe, Hor≈øe, Sheep, Amunition, &amp;c. And left them in
good condition to defend them≈øelves again≈øt the Rebells, the Ca≈øtle being very
≈øtrong of it ≈øelfe, and lying within a mile of the Town of Ro≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>When our Souldiers were at dinner, newes came that Generall Maccarte Tego
<pb facs="tcp:112787:2"/>
Downing, and ≈øome of Lord Muskery his Forces about 7000 Foote, and 300 Hor≈øe
were falle upon our three Companies, left at Cloughnieilty, and that they were in
great danger, whereupon the Lord Forbes together with his Captaine and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
with more then ordinary valour, courage and re≈øolution, ha≈øtened to relieve
them: and comming in ≈øight of the Rebels Army, and ≈øeeing two of our Colours
playing in a little brea≈øt worke beleagured with 1000 Rebells about them; we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
up neer them, and gave five to one of our Feild Pieces of Ordnance, which
made the Rebells retreate, whereby we re≈øcued two of our ≈øai<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> Companies, the
third being Captaine Weldon an old Souldier, but over Adventurous and more
relying upon his own valour, then hearkning to the advice of other Captaines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate,
very valiantly ≈øet upon the Rebells, and after he had killed many of them in
the battell was ≈ølaine him≈øelfe, together with about h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>lfe his Company.</p>
            <p>As ≈øoone as we had re≈øcued our two Companies, we fell upon the Rebels who
were in faire order of battell with divers Colours flying, and after ≈øome fight with
them, the Lord Forbes commanded to open to the right and left, and ≈øhot a piece
of Ordinance at them, whereupon they run away and were ≈øo routed that we ≈ølew
many of them upon our pur≈øuit, and following them ≈øo clo≈øe divers we forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, others got into an Iland, ≈øome into Bogs and Mountaines, and it was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,
and the great mercy of God that ≈øo great a defeat, upon ≈øo many by ≈øo
≈ømall a number was wrought in ≈øo ≈øhort a time, and not one of our men lo≈øt, in this
march we verily believe that there is 800 Rebels ≈ølaine, ≈øome thinke 12 or 500 and
among≈øt them many of the cheife Rebels and Commanders were ≈ølaine in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell;
the booty we took from the Rebels upon this defeate, was <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>000 Sheep 200
Cowes, and 50 Hor≈øe and Armes where with we marched to Bandon, and their left
the booty to relieve the Town. From Bandon we marched to Timoleage and burnt
the Town and Abby, and from thence came to King≈øale, where we found two of
our other Ships returned, which were ≈øent to guard the Coa≈øt, and to relieve Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
and Ca≈øtle-Haven, where were about 4. or 500. Engli≈øh.</p>
            <p>The Frigat Penington. Captaine Clark Commander hath done very good ≈øervice
a Baltimore by a ≈øtratagem having taken 17. Rebels there, ≈øome were the principall
of them one Captain Mac-Carte, Dermon and Clouke Tego Downing be≈øides ≈øome
others worth 500. l. Per Annum (as we are informed) they offer to ≈øupply provi≈øions
for our Fleet, and a good ran≈øom only to ≈øpare their lives, we are now Shipping our
men abord and ≈øo going to Baltimore.</p>
            <p>We are informed that Galloway is out in Rebellion again ≈øo it is intended that ≈øo
≈øoone as the Lord Forbes meets with the re≈øt of the Fleet, and is compleat, after he
≈øhall have releived ≈øome Ca≈øtles in the way, and cleered the Country. We ≈øhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to releive Galloway Ca≈øtle, and to ≈øet upon that Town if God pro≈øper us
we hope to carry it.</p>
            <p>It is reported that the L. Randelo, Lord Pre≈øident of Conaught, hath done great
≈øervice ≈øince the Rebellion, having got about 400 Engli≈øh, together at Atlon. And
Ro≈øcoman and hath fired the Country, 20 or 40 miles about, and hath inriched his
men with the ≈øpoyle taken from the Rebels, and upon a late ≈øupply of 2000. men
from Dublin it is hoped he will cleere mo≈øt part of that provence of Conaught, and
march to Galloway to joyn with our Sea and Land forces, to beleager the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:112787:3"/>
The Lord Forbes with the other Commanders intend to lo≈øe no time, but to doe
their uttermo≈øt in helping to reduce the Rebels to their due obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty,
and the Crown of England, it being high time, their in≈øolencies, and cruelties
were curbed, they commonly calling us Parliament dogs, and London Prenti≈øes, and
≈øay their commi≈ø≈øion for their Rebellion is better then ours, but we hope God will
inable us to help to quell their impudent cruelty.</p>
            <p>Two of our Fleet are gon to Duncannon Ca≈øtle and Dublin, to convoy ≈øome
provi≈øions and to bring advice of the ≈øtate of the Country, the Lord Forbers is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
from divers places for his aid and ≈øupply, his Lord≈øhip will give them the be≈øt
aid he can one after another, we hope this Fleet will do much good to this bleeding
Kingdom, and releive many poore drouping ≈øoules, and we hope our great Armies
in Lemp≈øter, and Vl≈øter, will with Gods ble≈ø≈øing cleere tho≈øe parts, and march into
Mon≈øter to cleere tho≈øe parts of the≈øe pro≈øidious Rebels, which he of his infinite
